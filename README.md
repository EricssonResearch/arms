The project scope is to develop a self-healing system for Radio Base Stations (RBS) developed by Ericsson. 

In general, a base station is a fixed point of communication in the mobile service and is among others equipped with various Digital Units (DUs), which fits several SFP transceiver ports to be able to connect to fiber cables with the use of respective SFP modules. Since nowadays mobile network operators frequently install these base stations in remote sites to cover most of a countries area, the cost of maintenance and downtime has raised noticeable for the main reason of the need to send technicians on long, time consuming trips. Therefore, a robotic assistant system can help to reduce these expenses by replacing a malfunction SFP module automatically.
